# MAGIC #
# MAGIC Construct a chain using LangChain such that when a user submits a question to the chain the following steps happen:
# MAGIC 1. Similarity search for your question on the vectorstore, i.e. ‚Äúwhich chunks of text have similar context/meaning as the question?‚Äù
# MAGIC 2. Retrieve the top `k` chunks
# MAGIC 3. Submit relevant chunks and your original question together to the LLM
# MAGIC 4. LLM answers the question with the relevant chunks as a reference
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We will also need to define some critical parameters, such as which LLM to use, how many text chunks (`k`) to retrieve, and model performance parameters.

# MAGIC Start with required libraries.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %run ./util/install-langchain-libraries

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Creating a dropdown widget for model selection from the previous step, as well as defining where our vectorstore was persisted and which embeddings model we want to use.

# COMMAND ----------

# where you want the transcripts to be saved
dbutils.widgets.text("model_endpoint", "https://e2-demo-field-eng.cloud.databricks.com/serving-endpoints/tgn-llm-qa/invocations")

# which embeddings model from Hugging Face ü§ó  you would like to use
dbutils.widgets.text("embeddings_model", "sentence-transformers/multi-qa-distilbert-cos-v1")

# where you want the vectorstore to be persisted across sessions, so that you don't have to regenerate
dbutils.widgets.text("vectorstore_path", "/dbfs/tmp/langchain_hls/db")

# where you want the Hugging Face models to be temporarily saved
hf_cache_path = "/dbfs/tmp/cache/hf"

# COMMAND ----------

#get widget values

# MAGIC ## Building a `langchain` Chain
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now we can compose the database with a language model and prompting strategy to make a `langchain` chain that answers questions.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Load the Chroma DB and define our retriever. We define `k` here, which is how many chunks of text we want to retrieve from the vectorstore to feed into the LLM
# MAGIC - Instantiate an LLM, loading from Databricks Model serving here, but could be other models or even OpenAI models
# MAGIC - Define how relevant texts are combined with a question into the LLM prompt

# COMMAND ----------

# Start here to load a previously-saved DB
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma

hf_embed = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=embeddings_model)
db = Chroma(collection_name="tgn_docs", embedding_function=hf_embed, persist_directory=vectorstore_path)

#k here is a particularly important parameter; this is how many chunks of text we want to retrieve from the vectorstore
retriever = db.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 5})

# COMMAND ----------

from langchain.llms import Databricks

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Note that there are _many_ factors that affect how the language model answers a question. Most notable is the prompt template itself. This can be changed, and different prompts may work better or worse with certain models.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The generation process itself also has many knobs to tune, and often it simply requires trial and error to find settings that work best for certain models and certain data sets. See this [excellent guide from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate). 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The settings that most affect performance are:
# MAGIC - `max_new_tokens`: longer responses take longer to generate. Reduce for shorter, faster responses
# MAGIC - `k`: the number of chunks of text retrieved into the prompt. Longer prompts take longer to process
# MAGIC - `num_beams`: if using beam search, more beams increase run time more or less linearly

# MAGIC ## Using the Chain for Simple Question Answering
# MAGIC
# MAGIC That's it! it's ready to go. Define a function to answer a question and pretty-print the answer, with sources.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC üö® Note:
# MAGIC Here we are using an LLM without any fine tuning on a specialized dataset. As a result, similar to any other question/answering model, the LLM's results are not reliable and can be factually incorrect.

# COMMAND ----------
